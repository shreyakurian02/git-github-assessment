GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[6] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[7]

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[8] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers[9] and more than 420 million repositories,[10] including at least 28 million public repositories.[11] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.

GitHub also operates a pastebin-style site called Gist, which is for code snippets[15]. Tom Preston-Werner débuted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.[94]

Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a pastebin by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and TLS encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.[95]

Gists' URLs use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a revision history, which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a "split" and "unified" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, "starred", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.[97]
